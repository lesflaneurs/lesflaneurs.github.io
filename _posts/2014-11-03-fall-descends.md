Rain. Wind. Cold. *Finally*.

It was almost 70° F the other day, and my brain has been yearning for more seasonally-appropriate weather. You might say I put up with warm weather, rather than enjoy it.

International wire transfers are the worst. I just spent fifteen minutes of my life listening to a godawful muzak loop only to be informed I should try again tomorrow, since the terminals literally *shut down* at 1pm PST (that's 10pm CET) and naught can be done until the great banking behemoths wrest themselves from their whinging slumber.

This is small potatoes, even for first-world problems, I'll grant you. That doesn't stop the rankling offense inherent in a system of arcane incantations that doesn't even shuffle physical goods around, just the fricking binary representations of credits and debits of a collective hallucination we call "money". (Don't even get me started on how many times I have to clarify slowly and calmly that I need the amount transferred in euros, not dollars, every single grue-forsaken time I brave this hellish phonoscape.)

Anyway, where was I? Shuffling some bits of my own, back and forth as I plow neat rows into my digital plot. Plenty of fertilizer.

The trees have been dumping, and up until late last night, it made for emergent drifts of gold and bronze down the rues and across the boulevards. The advent of rain has stopped the frolicking, turning deciduous vortices into a delicate slurry of dead [chloroplasts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloroplast). Really, I could go on all day with these twenty-dollar words.

I am really enjoying [Byword](http://bywordapp.com), a text editor I picked up just today on the Mac App Store. I'm a tool-nerd descended from tool-nerds, and that's okay. It helps the work go more smoothly, which seems to me is the point of tools in the first place. My tools aren't a perfectly balanced hammer or a trusty Phillips-head screwdriver, but that's okay too. They matter just as much.

Now, don't mind me, I'm gonna go slink off to *le Bazar de l'Hôtel de Ville* and buy an umbrella, because Paris is not equipped with the infrastructure (covered sidewalks, robust conifers) nor the sartorial permissiveness (the North Face is largely *persona non grata*) of Seattle's local "I don't need an umbrella" hubris, and boy is that rain cold.
