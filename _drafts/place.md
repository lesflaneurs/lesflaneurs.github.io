Place is a stubborn concept. Place-ness. Place-hood. One of the hopes I had going into this was that a change of place would produce a change of perspective, altering experience in some fundamental way that would yield distinctive memories.

Was I foolish? Not entirely, but there is a strong thread of misplaced expectations.

I'm sitting on a bench in the Parc de Belleville, in the 20th arrondissement. I walked all the way from the 4th, which is not really that impressive since the numbering progresses in a nautilus-like spiral with its origin in the center of Paris. A meandering nor'easterly pilgrimage.

I had decent sushi for lunch, in the 11th. I didn't use any English.

Places can be emotional as well as spatial, of course. Living abroad with no anchors save the snail-like pursuit of a coquettish language lends itself famously to such immanence. I am now in a place of wincing, percussive lack, missing the ministrations of family and friends and familiarity. I expected it to have passed already, but I have no basis for that assumption other than wishful thinking.

All that is left, all that ever remains, is to do the work. One foot in front of the other.

I already have memories, a sort of premature nostalgia, about places in Paris (Jules Ferry, Oberkampf, and more). That alone is privilege enough, but so much about  the act of living somewhere makes those fond reverberations ring, if not exactly false, then full of wolf notes. My brain can't survive more than three weeks straight of the experiential machine-gun of travel, and I'm not sure anyone can persevere for more than a month.

The sun as it descends sends golden light through shrivelling green boughs touched with hints of yellow and orange. Bamboo to my right laugh haughtily in their seemingly-evergreen countenance, whispering aspersions on the lazy birch and elm. A brumbly river of escalating humanity dawdles by, the distant cacophony of a playground accentuating the calm. A skittish calico darts across the path, pauses in a sunbeam to survey her domain, and then courses muscularly up the green to the dark safety of a bush.

The fall breeze talks to the trees, caressing softly the branches soon bare.
