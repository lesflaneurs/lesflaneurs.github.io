# A Grand Adventure

August 15th will be my last day at Zillow.

Six years is a long time. Not long enough, however, to prepare me to write this
email. I am overcome with gratitude, wistfulness, and excitement.
Words become strange after you stare at them for hours.

Zillow has changed a lot during my time here, but it remains as challenging,
exciting, and rewarding as the day I started. I have had the great fortune to
work with great colleagues, ship tons of features, and make many friends.

Thanks to Zillow, I have grown as an engineer, as an individual, and as a
citizen of the world. I will remain eternally grateful.

Maureen (my wife) and I are embarking on a new adventure: moving to Paris,
France, and living abroad for a year. A lifelong dream, a life-changing
experience, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

I expect great things from Zillow. I am confident that I will not be
disappointed. The future is bright.
